Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary heap data structure. It is an in-place algorithm with an average and worst-case time complexity of
O(nlogn), making it efficient for large datasets. The heap sort algorithm consists of two main phases: building a max-heap (or min-heap) and repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap and rebuilding the heap.
